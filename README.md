For CEMI414's 2015 group assignment 1, the efficient functioning of artificial neural networks in the fields of process modelling and
inferential control have to be investigated. The study should include a comprehensive literature review as well as a practical
demonstration of an artificial neural network in the field of inferential control.

Instead of just constructing a fixed neural network, a program was written to build **any** neural network the user wants.
This is the repo of *that* program.

Feel free to browse through the source code or download a release.
